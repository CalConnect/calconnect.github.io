=== ICALENDAR

==== History

The iCalendar specification was first produced by the IETF in 1998 as
RFC 2445 [1]. Since then it has become the dominant standard for
calendar data interchange on the internet and between devices (desktop
computers, mobile phones etc). The specification was revised in 2009 as
RFC 5545 [4]. +
 +
Alongside iCalendar is the iTIP specification (RFC 2446 [2] and revised
as RFC 5546 [5]) that defines how iCalendar is used to carry out
scheduling operations (for example, how an organizer can invite
attendees to a meeting and receive their replies). This forms the basis
for email-based scheduling using iMIP (the specification that describes
how to use iTIP with email) (RFC 2447 [3]) and revised as RFC 6047
[12]). iCalendar itself is a text-based data format. However, an XML
format is also available, providing a one-to-one mapping to the text
format (RFC 6321 [7]). +
 +
iCalendar data files typically have a .ics file name extension. Most
desktop calendar clients can import or export iCalendar data, or
directly access such data over the Internet using a variety of
protocols.

==== Data Model

The iCalendar data format has a well defined data model. "iCalendar
objects" encompass a set of "iCalendar components" each of which
contains a set of "iCalendar properties" and possibly other
sub-components. An iCalendar property consists of a name, a set of
optional parameters (specified as "key-value" pairs) and a value. +
 +
iCalendar components include:

* "VEVENT" which represents an event
* "VTODO" which represents a task or to-do
* "VJOURNAL" which represents a journal entry
* "VFREEBUSY" which represents periods of free or busy time information
* "VTIMEZONE" which represents a timezone definition (timezone offset
and daylight saving rules)
** "STANDARD" and "DAYLIGHT" are sub-components of "VTIMEZONE" and
provide the onset and offset information
* "VALARM" is currently the only defined sub-component for events and
tasks and is used to set alarms or reminders

Properties include:

* "DTSTART" which represents a start time for a component
* "DTEND" which represents an end time for a component
* "SUMMARY" which represents a title or summary for a component
* "RRULE" which can specify rules for repeating events or tasks (for
example, every day, every week on Tuesdays, etc.)
* "ORGANIZER" which represents the calendar user who is organizing an
event or assigning a task
* "ATTENDEE" which represents calendar users attending an event or
assigned a task

In addition to this data model and the pre-defined properties, the
specification defines how all those are used together to define the
semantics of calendar objects and scheduling. The semantics are
basically a set of rules stating how all the components and properties
are used together to ensure that all iCalendar products can work
together to achieve good interoperability. For example, a rule requires
that all events must have one and only one "DTSTART" property. The most
important part of the iCalendar specification is the semantics of the
calendaring model that it represents. The use of text or XML to encode
those is secondary.

==== Scheduling

The iTIP specification defines how iCalendar objects are exchanged in
order to accomplish the key task needed to schedule events or tasks. An
example of a simple workflow is as follows:

* To schedule an event, an organizer creates the iCalendar object
representing the event and adds calendar users as attendees. The
organizer then sends an iTIP "REQUEST" message to all the attendees.
* Upon receipt of the scheduling message, each attendee can decide
whether they want to attend the meeting or not.
* Each attendee can then respond back to the organizer using an iTIP
"REPLY" message indicating their own attendance status.

iTIP supports other types of scheduling messages, for example, to cancel
meetings, add new instances to a repeating meeting, etc.

==== Extensibility

iCalendar was designed to be extensible, allowing for new components,
properties and parameters to be defined as needed. A registry exists to
maintain the list of standard extensions with references to their
definitions to ensure anyone can use them and work well with others.

==== WS-Calendar

WS-Calendar [13], jointly developed by The Calendaring and Scheduling
Consortium and OASIS, is one such extension to iCalendar. It is intended
to provide a data model sufficient for the needs of the NIST Smart Grid
Interoperability Standards. Many of these extensions to iCalendar also
appear to be of use in project management, financial management, and
other areas focused primarily on scheduling _per se_.

=== CALENDAR DATA ACCESS AND EXCHANGE PROTOCOLS

==== Internet Calendar Downloads

Calendar data can be downloaded from a web server via a web browser and
then imported directly into an iCalendar aware client. Alternatively,
calendar data could be retrieved in some other fashion from the Internet
(e.g., sent via email as an attachment) and then imported into a
calendar client. +
 +
This solution works well for calendar data that is not likely to change
over time (for example the list of national holidays for the next year).

==== Internet Calendar Subscriptions

An Internet calendar subscription is simply an iCalendar data file made
available on a web server. However, rather than using a web browser to
download the calendar data, calendar clients can instead use the URL to
the calendar data on the web server to download the calendar data
themselves. Additionally, the clients can check the web server on a
regular basis for updates to the calendar data, and then update their
own cached copy of it. This allows calendar data that changes over time
to be kept synchronized.

==== CalDAV

CalDAV is a calendar access protocol and is defined in RFC 4791 [6]. The
protocol is based on WebDAV which is an extension to HTTP that provides
enhanced capabilities for document management on web servers. +
 +
CalDAV is used in a variety of different environments, ranging from very
large internet service providers, to large and small corporations or
institutions, and to small businesses and individuals. +
 +
CalDAV clients include desktop applications, mobile devices and
browser-based solutions. It can also be used by "applets", for example,
a web page panel that displays a user's upcoming events. +
 +
One of the key aspects of CalDAV is its data model. Simply put, it
defines a "calendar home" for each calendar user, within which any
number of "calendars" can be created. Each "calendar" can contain any
number of iCalendar objects representing individual events, tasks or
journal entries. This data model ensures that clients and servers can
interoperate well. +
 +
In addition to providing simple operations to read, write and delete
calendar data, CalDAV provides a querying mechanism to allow clients to
fetch calendar data matching specific criteria. This is commonly used by
clients to do "time-range" queries, i.e., find the set of events that
occur within a given start/end time period. +
 +
CalDAV also supports access control allowing for features such as
delegated calendars and calendar sharing. +
 +
CalDAV also specifies how scheduling operations can be done using the
protocol, rather than, for example, sending scheduling messages via
email. Whilst it uses the semantics of the iTIP protocol, it simplifies
the process by allowing simple calendar data write operations to trigger
the sending of scheduling messages, and it has the server automatically
process the receipt of scheduling messages. Scheduling can be done with
other users on the CalDAV server or with calendar users on other systems
(via some form of "gateway").

==== CalWS-REST

CalWS-REST[10] is a RESTful web services calendar access application
programming interface developed by The Calendaring and Scheduling
Consortium and the OASIS organization, to be used as part of the OASIS
WS-Calendar standard. It provides a programing interface to access and
manipulate calendar data stored on a server that is more suited to a web
services programming environment. It follows a similar data model to
CalDAV and has been designed to co-exist with a CalDAV service offering
the same data.

==== CalWS-SOAP

CalWS-SOAP (under development) is a SOAP web services calendar access
application programming interface still under development by The
Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium and OASIS and is also to be used
as part of the OASIS WS-Calendar standard. As with CalWS-REST, it
follows a similar model to CalDAV and provides slightly more features
than the current CalWS-REST protocol.

==== iSchedule

iSchedule [11] is a protocol to allow scheduling between users on
different calendaring systems and across different internet domains. It
transports iTIP scheduling messages using HTTP between servers. Servers
use DNS and various security mechanisms to determine the authenticity of
messages received. It has been specifically designed to be independent
of any calendar system in use at the endpoints, so that it is compatible
with many different systems. This allows organizations with different
calendar systems to exchange scheduling messages with each other, and
also allows a single organization with multiple calendar systems (for
example due to mergers, or different departmental requirements) to
exchange scheduling messages between users of each system. +
 +
 

==== ActiveSync/SyncML

ActiveSync [8] and SyncML [9] are technologies that allow multiple
devices to synchronize data with a server, with calendar data being one
of the classes of data supported. These have typically been used for
mobile devices with a broad spectrum of capabilities, but most often in
"smart" phones.

==== Exchange Web Services (EWS)

Exchange Web Services [14] is another technology that allow multiple
devices to synchronize data with an Exchange server, with calendar data
being one of the classes of data supported. It is a SOAP based protocol
introduced with Exchange 2007 which manages a proprietary data format.
