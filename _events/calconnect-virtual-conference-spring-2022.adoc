*Introduction*

CalConnect intends to hold several Virtual Conference days or
specialized  topic sessions in the Spring of 2022.  Detailed planning
has not yet begun as of mid-January but we hope to have a schedule
developed over the next few weeks.  These may follow  the model we used
for the Autumn 2021 Virtual Conference, or the related CalendarFest or
specialized one-day in-depth topics.
