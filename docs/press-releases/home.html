Welcome to CalConnect<sup><small>SM</small></sup> &#151; The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium.  The Consortium is focused on the interoperable
exchange of calendaring and scheduling information between dissimilar programs,
platforms, and technologies. The Consortium's mission is to promote general
understanding of and provide mechanisms to allow interoperable calendaring and scheduling
methodologies, tools and applications to enter the mainstream of computing.<br>


<br>
<b>Recent Developments</b> (as of 10 March 2006)<br>
<ul>
<li><b>CalConnect Co-Sponsors Free/Busy Workshop</b>:  The Calendaring and
Scheduling Consortium is co-sponsoring a <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/messaging/public/apr-2006/fb-workshop.htm" target="_blank">Workshop on Federated Free/Busy</a>
in association with The Open Group Messaging Forum.  The workshop will be held on
April 25th during The Open Group member meetings in Washington, D.C.  Members
of the Consortium are entitled to a special affiliate registration fee.
</li>
<br>
<li><b>Interoperability Test Results Posted</b>:  The public results from the
CalConnect Interoperability Test Event in January have been posted to the
website in the <b>Event Reports</b> Section (see sidebar) or at <a href="ioppast.html">
CalConnect IOPs</a>.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Roundtable VI at IBM/Lotus, Cambridge, Massachusetts</b>:  IBM/Lotus will
host the May 22-25 Roundtable VI and associated CalConnect Interoperability Event
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Logistics and events information may be found in the
<b>Coming Events</b> Section of this website (see sidebar) or at
<a href="roundtable6.html">Roundtable VI</a>.  The page will be updated
frequently as more information becomes available.  The Consortium expects that
registration will open for the event no later than March 15.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Roundtable V at Novell, Provo, Utah</b>: Roundtable V and the associated
CalConnect Interoperability Event took place January 9-12, hosted by Novell Inc.
in Provo, Utah.  A short report on the Roundtable may be found in the <b>Event
Reports</b> of the Consortium website (see sidebar) or at
<a href="roundtable5.html">Roundtable V</a>.  The report on the interoperability

section.</li>
<br> 
<li><b>iCalendar TIMEZONE Problems and Recommendations</b>:
The TIMEZONE Technical Committee has published a document identifying problems
with common timezone implementation issue and recommendations on how to resolve
these issues.  The document is available from the <b>Work Products</b> area of the 
Consortium website (see sidebar) or at 
<a href="publications/icalendartimezoneproblemsandrecommendationsv1.0.pdf">
iCalendar TIMEZONE Problems and Recommendations</a>.</li>
<br>
<li><b>New Version of Min-IOP Use Cases Document</b>:
The USECASE Technical Committee has published an update to its Min-IOP Use Cases
Document defining minimum interoperability of calendaring and scheduling: the basic functionality
required to have a useful system, as determined by the collective experience of
the members of the technical committee. The
document is available from the <b>Work Products</b> area of the Consortium
website (see sidebar) or at <a href="publications/miniopusecasesv1.0.pdf">Min-IOP Use Cases</a>.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Interoperability Test Case Matrices</b>:
The matrices used for specifying interoperability testing validations for both the 
iCalendar RFCs and the CalDAV calendar access protocol have been posted in the 
<b>Resources</b> area of the Consortium website (see sidebar) or at <a href="ioptesting.html">
CalConnect Interoperability Event testing</a>.</li>
