Internet-Draft          Timezones Author Registry          November 2008


1.  Introduction

   The lack of standardized timezone registries and service has led to a
   number of significant problems for vendors and users alike, for
   example, the daylight savings time changes for the US in 2007.

   In this document we define a timezone author registry which will
   allow authors of timezone information to make themselves known in a
   standardized manner.

   No guarantee as to the quality of that data or of the means of
   production is implied by registration.  It is up to the providers of
   that information and the services to make such guarantees.

   Later specification will define the role of timezone information
   providers a timezone service and apis.

1.1.  XML Namespaces

   Definitions of XML elements in this document use XML element type
   declarations (as found in XML Document Type Declarations), described
   in Section 3.2 of [W3C.REC-xml-20060816].

   The namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:timezones" is reserved for the
   XML elements defined in this specification, or in other Standards
   Track IETF RFCs written to extend timezones.  It MUST NOT be used for
   proprietary extensions.

   Note that the XML declarations used in this document are incomplete,
   in that they do not include namespace information.  Thus, the reader
   MUST NOT use these declarations as the only way to validate timezones
   XML element types.

1.2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

1.2.1.  Glossary of terms

   The following terms with the given meanings are used throughout this
   document.

Internet-Draft          Timezones Author Registry          November 2008


   Author:  A registered organization of some kind which creates
      timezone information, e.g.  Olson;

   Client:  Software which interacts with a timezone service;

   Provider:  A registered organization which makes timezone information
      produced by an Author available;

   Registry:  A file maintained by IANA;

   Timezone Identifier:  A name which identifies the timezone.  The
      format and meaning is unchanged from the definition in section
      3.8.3.1 [RFC2445].  See below for further clarification of the use
      of the timezone identifier.


2.  Timezone Specification Implications

   The timezone author registry has minimal implications for the current
   timezone specification as defined in [RFC2445].  However certain
   assumptions are made about property values as outlined below.

2.1.  Timezone Identifiers

   In [RFC2445] the timezone identifier used in the VTIMEZONE TZID
   property is defined as being an optional "/" followed by text.  When
   the leading "/" is present the name is defined as being a globally
   unique name.

   With this specification we achieve this uniqueness by defining a
   timezone identifier as having the following format:

   [ "/" author-part "/" ] name-part

   The author-part identifies an author as defined in the author
   registry for example "EXAMPLE.COM" and may not contain the "/"
   character.  The name part identifies the timezone for example,
   "America/New_York" and may contain the "/" character.

   The expectation is that a primary timezone author will be used almost
   universally.  However, certain organizations may have special needs
   that require special purpose timezone definitions or more rigorous
   control over their production, for example government or military
   uses.

   This scheme allows for multiple authors where necessary.

Internet-Draft          Timezones Author Registry          November 2008


2.2.  Timezone Names

   The TZNAME property can occur multiple times and has an optional
   language parameter.  Its intent was clearly to provide the localized
   forms of the timezone name for presentation to users.

   This property will NOT be maintained by the timezone service.
   Instead there will be a separate option to fetch identifiers and
   their associated localized forms.

2.3.  Timezone Url

   The timezone url WILL be maintained by timezone providers and will be
   a url by which that individual timezone specification can be
   retrieved.  Etags WILL be used to allow clients to determine that the
   timezone is up to date.


3.  Timezone Data Authors

   Timezone data is created and maintained by timezone authors.  An
   author is an organization or individual.  An example is Olson, a
   person who represents a group of individuals maintaining the well
   known Olson database.

   Timezone authors will generally have some well-known process for
   locating and maintaining the data they provide as the consumers of
   that data need to be able to reply on its correctness and the
   longevity of the source.


4.  Timezones Author Registry

   The author registry provides an identifying name for an author of
   timezone information, some form of contact information and a location
   from which the timezone data can be fetched.  It is assumed that the
   data will be fetched infrequently - for example when it changes.

   The author registry consists of an xml formatted file containing some
   informational elements, version, timestamp, and one or more author
   elements.

   Each author element in the registry identifies an author and has the
   following sub-elements:

Internet-Draft          Timezones Author Registry          November 2008


   name:  The text that appears as the author-name part of timezone
      identifiers supplied by this provider.

   url:  Provides a way - which may require human intervention - to
      obtain the information provided by this author.

   contact:  Provides a way - which may require human intervention - to
      contact the author.  This may be for example, a vcard url, a
      telephone number or a web site

   description:  Some further human-readable information.

4.1.  Updating the Timezone Author Registry

   This section should describe how an author gets registered and how
   the registry gets updated and who can do it.

4.2.  Example: Timezone Author Registry

   In this example we show an xml formatted timezone registry.

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
   <timezone-author-registry xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:timezones">
     <version>1.0</version>
     <dtstamp>2008-11-13T03:45:06Z</dtstamp>

     <author>
       <name>OLSON</name>
       <url>https://example.org/downloads/OlsonData</url>
       <contact>http://example.org/carddav/orgs/Olson</contact>
       <description>An author of timezone information
       </description>
       <certficate type="X509">...</certificate>
     </author>

     <author>
       <name>EXAMPLE.ORG</name>
       <url>ftp://example.org/ExampleData</url>
       <contact>telephone:+1 555 555 1234</contact>
     </author>
   </timezone-author-registry>

Internet-Draft          Timezones Author Registry          November 2008


5.1.  TZ:timezone-author-registry XML element

   The TZ:timezone-author-registry element is the top level author
   registry element and contains a version and one or more author
   elements.

           <!ELEMENT timezone-author-registry (version, author*)>

5.2.  TZ:version XML element

   The TZ:version element identifies the version of the registry
   definition.  Currently only version 1.0 is defined.

           <!ELEMENT version (#PCDATA)>

5.3.  TZ:dtstamp XML element

   The TZ:dtstamp element allows consumers to determine if the registry
   has changed.

           <!ELEMENT dtstamp (#PCDATA)>

5.4.  author XML element

   The author element identifies a timezones data author.

           <!ELEMENT author (name, url, contact, description)>

5.5.  name XML element

   The name element identifies the author.  This name appears as a
   prefix to the timezone identifiers.

           <!ELEMENT name  (#PCDATA)>

5.6.  url XML element

   The url element provides a provides a way - which may require human
   intervention - to obtain the information provided by this author.

           <!ELEMENT url  (#PCDATA)>

5.7.  contact XML element

   The contact element provides a provides a way - which may require
   human intervention - to contact the author.

           <!ELEMENT contact  (#PCDATA)>

5.8.  description XML element

   The description element provides some further information.

           <!ELEMENT description  (#PCDATA)>


6.  Security Considerations

   The information maintained by the IANA will be authoritative and will
   be a target for attack.  The content maintained by the IANA may be
   directly input into software, thus, extra care should be taken by the
   IANA to maintain the security precautions required for an important
   reference location for the Internet.

   To increase the level of confidence in the registry data itself it
   should be digitally signed.

   Beyond this concern, there are no other security considerations not
   already found with any other IANA registry.


7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Namespace Registration

   This document uses one new URN to identify a new XML namespace.  The
   URN conforms to a registry mechanism described in [RFC3688].

   Registration request for the timezones namespace:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:timezones

   Registrant Contact: See the "Authors' Addresses" section of this
   document.

   XML: None.  Namespace URIs do not represent an XML specification.

7.2.  Registry

   This document seeks to create a registry for which the IANA (at the
   direction of the IESG) will be primarily responsible.  The amount of
   effort required to maintain this registry is not insignificant and
   the policies and procedures surrounding any approval process are non-
   trivial.  The registry is on a First Come First Served basis, but a
   Specification is Required.  Once the IETF has some experience with
   this registry, these policies may change.
