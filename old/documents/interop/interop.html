This material was transferred from the CALSCH site formerly at MIT to The
Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium website.  It contains information about
Interoperability Testing Events which were (or were going to be) conducted by CALSCH from 2000-2003.
Future Interoperability Testing Events will be conducted by The Calendaring and
Scheduling Consortium and information about future and past events will be posted
to this website as appropriate.

<td VALIGN=TOP>The Calendaring and Scheduling working group &nbsp;
coordinates interoperability testing on our current RFCs. These include
RFC2445 (iCalendar), RFC2446(iTIP) and RFC2447(iMIP).
<p>There have already been several events.  Click on the links to the right for results.
<p>We have been quite lucky to have wonderful support from organizations
to help move along the interoperability testing.&nbsp; Our first and second interop
tests were graciously hosted by MIT and Stanford University, respectively.&nbsp;
