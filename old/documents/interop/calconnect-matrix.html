<br><a NAME="a1"></a>The purpose of this testing is to move the iCalendar,
iMIP and iTIP proposed standards to the next level, Draft Standard.&nbsp;
The following text describes what must occur.&nbsp; This is from RFC2026,
section 4.1.2.
<br>- - - - - - - -
<br>A specification from which at least two independent and interoperable
implementations from different code bases have been developed, and for
which sufficient successful operational experience has been obtained, may
be elevated to the "Draft Standard" level.&nbsp; For the purposes of this
section, "interoperable" means to be functionally equivalent or interchangeable
components of the system or process in which they are used.&nbsp; If patented
or otherwise controlled technology is required for implementation, the
separate implementations must also have resulted from separate exercise
of the licensing process.&nbsp;&nbsp; Elevation to Draft Standard is a
major advance in status, indicating a strong belief that the specification
is mature and will be useful.
<p>The requirement for at least two independent and interoperable implementations
applies to all of the options and features of the
<br>specification.&nbsp; In cases in which one or more options or features
have not been demonstrated in at least two interoperable
<br>implementations, the specification may advance to the Draft Standard
level only if those options or features are removed.
<p>The Working Group chair is responsible for documenting the specific
implementations which qualify the specification for Draft or Internet Standard
status along with documentation about testing of the interoperation of
these implementations.&nbsp; The documentation must include information
about the support of each of the individual options and features.&nbsp;
This documentation should be submitted to the Area Director with the protocol
action request. (see Section 6)
<p>A Draft Standard must be well-understood and known to be quite stable,
both in its semantics and as a basis for developing an
<br>implementation.&nbsp; A Draft Standard may still require additional
or more widespread field experience, since it is possible for
<br>implementations based on Draft Standard specifications to demonstrate
unforeseen behavior when subjected to large-scale use in production environments.
A Draft Standard is normally considered to be a final specification, and
changes are likely to be made only to solve specific problems encountered.&nbsp;
In most circumstances, it is reasonable for vendors to&nbsp; deploy implementations
of Draft Standards into a disruption sensitive environment.

<hr NOSHADE WIDTH="100%">
<br><a NAME="c1"></a><b>CONDITIONS AND THEIR MEANINGS</b>
<p>1. <b>MUST</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL",
mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.
<br>2. <b>MUST NOT</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT",
mean that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.
<br>3. <b>SHOULD</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED",
mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to
ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood
and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
<br>4. <b>SHOULD NOT</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED"
mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when
the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications
should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing
any behavior described with this label.
<br>5. <b>MAY</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean
that an item is truly optional.&nbsp; One vendor may choose to include
the item because a particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor
feels that it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same
item. An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST
be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does include
the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
same vein an implementation which does include a particular option MUST
be prepared to interoperate with another&nbsp; implementation which does
not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the option provides.)
