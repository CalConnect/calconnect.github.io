   <title>CalConnect 1 - April 11-12,2000</title>
</head>
<body>
On April 11 and 12, 2000, CalConnect Spring
was held in Boston. It was graciously hosted by MIT and chaired by Bob
Mahoney.
<p>The following companies and representatives were in attendance:
<p>Tom Ransdell, Lotus,
<br>Dan Gurney, Iris/Lotus,
<br>John Sun, iPlanet,
<br>Ki Wong, iPlanet,
<br>Katia Hage, Microsoft,
<br>Colin DuPlantis, Critical Path,
<br>Bob Mahoney, MIT,
<br>Paul Hill, MIT.
<p>Pat Egen sat at home with a broken leg, and assisted (poorly) from the
sidelines.
<p>The following products and versions were tested:
<p>EventCenter Version 3.0 (Critical Path)
<br>Outlook 2000 and Outlook Express 5.0 (Microsoft)
<br>iPlanet - internal unreleased alpha version iCS 5.0, server and client
(Netscape)
<br>Organizer (Lotus)
<p>First off, thanks to everyone for their efforts.&nbsp; There was&nbsp;
consensus that all participants have a lot of work to do, and that
<br>another testing event should be held in the fall.&nbsp; A west coast&nbsp;
location was suggested, although some interest was also expressed&nbsp;
for New Orleans or San Antonio.&nbsp; All participants felt that great
progress would be made in the coming months.
<p>Little interoperability has occurred so far. Repeating events and&nbsp;
canceled events seem to be causing problems. Parsers are working OK&nbsp;
but the actual generation of the data objects is very inconsistent.
<p>Problems found with recurrence included the following:
<br>- one vendor always generates and expects rrules, but cannot handle
rdates.
<br>- two vendors always generate rdates and cannot currently handle rrules.
<br>- one vendor handles rrules but cannot handle exceptions.
<p>There was a brief discussion about redesigning recurrence. Some useful
alternatives were suggested but the developers also seemed to be willing
to live with the current specification. They did feel that word-smithing
would help.&nbsp; This will be brought back to the list in more detail
for some review.
<p>The biggest complaints are currently with iMIP and the MIME handling.
"iMIP under-constrains what may be emitted by a data source; this requires
a client to handle every possible case" which is perceived as a heavy burden
by the developers.
<p>Regarding MIME: "(multipart mixed vs. multipart alternative vs. text-alternative
vs.attachments ...)" - the developers would be happier if there fewer options,
or perhaps some stronger assertions in the draft.&nbsp; This too will be
put on the list.
<p>There has been virtually no interoperability testing of alarms yet.
There were some side issues relating to alarms, which will be brought back
to the list.
<p>There has been virtually no testing of conformance with line lengths
yet.
<p>A number of minor problems with blank spaces, terminating lines, and
MIME boundaries were observed and are in the process of being fixed by
the implementors.
<p>No tester has fully implemented Journals. One vendor has the support
in the parser but no support in the front end, so they cannot be generated
or displayed by the product. All of the implementors indicate that supporting
Journals is intended and that no obstaclesare seen, they are just lower
on the priority list so far.
<p>There has been no testing of signed or encrypted objects. This should
be a major goal of the next testing event.
<p>Some progress is better than no progress.&nbsp; Look for additional
activity on the list as we post some of the items referenced above.&nbsp;
CalConnect Fall will be announced later in the year.
<p>Respectfully submitted,
<p>Pat Egen and Bob Mahoney
