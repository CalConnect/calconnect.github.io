<br><a NAME="a1"></a><b>DETAILS</b>
<p>This was our first "virtual" interop.&nbsp; During this interop, we tested RFCs 2445, 2446 and 2447 (iCalendar, iTIP and iMIP) over the
internet.&nbsp; (What a concept!).&nbsp; Everyone has limited time and
budgets so it has made it tough to get an "in-person interop" going.
<p>This virtual testing worked as follows.
<ul>
<li>
There was a secure server that had IMAP and POP capability so
we can test sending calendar entries.</li>

<li>
There was a virtual Team Room, again secure with log-ons, where people
can hold discussions on-line (similar to AOL and MSN, but encrypted).&nbsp;
This is where everyone was able to mark off when a MUST or SHOULD has
worked/not worked/almost worked and where comments can be made.</li>

<li>
We had an agenda that will set up times to do the testing and times
to stop and chat about where we are at that point in the testing.&nbsp;
These was finalized the week of the interop testing.</li>

<li>
Everyone that participated on this interop was asked to devote the full
time to the testing - i.e. assume you are away from the office during the
testing (even though you are not).</li>

<li>
We had regular conference calls set at certain intervals during the
two days.</li>

<li>
Results on testing was provided by each participant to the chair, .</li>

<li>
The chair will summarize the results and report them, confidentially, to
the IETF Area Directors.</li>

<li>
All confidentiality rules observed at a normal interop testing was
observed during the virtual testing.</li>

<li>
This shall be a low cost interop - the costs was for the conference
calling facility and that was based on how many people sign up for
the virtual testing.&nbsp; When we know the number, we will estimate the
costs and we will divide it equally among the participants.&nbsp; We do
not foresee this being more than $100 per organization.</li>
</ul>
Prior to the interop, we will send out notices with url's for the conferencing
tool.

<p><b>Dates:</b>
<br>-------------------
<br>The official dates for the CalConnect testing are September 4-5, 2002.
These was two full days of testing .
<p><b>Testing Schedule and rules:</b>
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br>The preliminary schedule is as follows.
<p>Day 1
<br>8:30 - Conference Call to start process and confirm connectivity
<br>9:30 - 12:00 - Testing
<br>12:00 - Conference Call to discuss testing.
<br>1:00 - until - 4:00 Testing
<br>4:00 - Conference Call
<p>Day 2
<br>8:30 - Conference Call to start process for the day and to review yesterday's
events.
<br>9:00 - 12:00 - Testing
<br>12:00 - Conference Call to discuss testing
<br>1:00 - 4:30 - Testing
<br>4:30 on - Conference call for Review and shut down and to discuss how
to send Notes to chair.
<p><b>Testing rules:</b>
<br>-----------------------
<br>Participants use their own equipment and software.&nbsp; A conference
calling service was used and the numbers was provided by the Chair.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Testing of applications and code is open.&nbsp; This means there are no
set steps or processes involved.&nbsp; You had a list of participants
and will know what each vendor or representative wants to test. It is every
recipients responsibility to find other participants to test applications.
<p>This effort will test everything we can on iCalendar, iTIP and iMIP.&nbsp;
The major emphasis was on the iCalendar protocol.&nbsp; The chairs
will provide a matrix of all MUST, CAN and SHOULD statements that can be
used to help "check off" what is working and what is not.&nbsp; Each participant
is expected to detail what works and what does not and expected plans for
fixing or not fixing sections that do not work.&nbsp; If nothing will happen
on a specific item and participants do not plan to fix or make pieces work,
those items must be removed from the draft.
<p>The key rule is "What happens during testing remains in the room."&nbsp;
It is expected that participants will honor this rule.&nbsp; No press is
allowed and for the participants, please do not bring Marketing staff.
<p>The chairs of the CALSCH working group will publish the results and
further the movement of the RFC towards Standard activation.

<p>Vendor1 problems:
<br>• If the ical-attachment is send MIME-encoded, in a form that affects
it's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plaintext appearence (in the mail), Vendor1 can't
read it properly/at all. This occured only with Vendor4-products.
<br>• Vendor1 doesn't send timezone information when dealing with recurring
events.
<br>• "UNTIL" in RRULE isn't set as correct UTC-value
<br>• Vendor1 can't deal with ical-attachments
<br>• almost all other bugs that occured are fixed already
<p>Other Problems:
<br>• Vendor2's Client didn't send "Organizer"-information in their REPLY-messages
as requestred in RFC 2445 3.2.3
<br>• some more I can't remember, and which may be fixed already
<p>Communication with Vendor3 had no problems.
<br>Communication with Vendor2 had only the one above mentioned REPLY-problem.
<br>Communication with Vendor4 is very limited (see MIME-problem).
<p>Personal note:
<br>It's unluky, that we had some technical problems, that handicaped communication,and
stole a lot of time. So testing was limited to some basics of
<p>Results:
<br>=========
<br>We were not able to test as much as in the previous calconnect, which
was more
<br>productive. We mostly tried creating and replying to events, thus the
methods
<br>that were tested were REQUEST and REPLY.

<p>Miscellaneous:
<br>--------------
<br>• We had some success with CANCEL and updates (REQUEST). However, we
do not remember with
<br>which vendors. Vendor3 had success processing a VEVENT that we sent
to it that had different character set in it. Some vendors were also able
to process a REQUEST we sent that had multiple RDATEs.
<br>• Vendor2 had trouble with line folding, multipart/mixed, and they
required that attendees
<br>have a common name ("CN").
<br>• Vendor1 had trouble with quoted-printable, and had a DTSTART in UTC
for events
<br>with RRULEs. According to iCalendar, when a DTSTART is used with a
recurrence rule,
<br>it must be specified local time.
<p>Vendor 3 Notes:
<p>Microsoft and 2 others were scheduled to participate but did not show
up.&nbsp; Unfortunately we had some technical issues testing w/Vendor4
folks and there were some server uptime issues inhouse that increased the
testing lag on our end.
<p>The Good News:
<p>We were successfully able to do non-repeating and repeating meeting
testing with all implementations.&nbsp; We were able to both send and receive
invitations to single instance and repeating meetings just fine.&nbsp;
We were also able to send attachments along with each type of invitation
and they were at least received correctly by the other testers (although
some did not know how to deal with multipart MIME data yet for assorted
reasons).
<p>Particular notes relating to specific implementations:
<p>Vendor4:
<br>Vendor4 did not send us any tests with attachments so we were not able
to fully test that feature inbound to Notes.
<p>Vendor 1:
<br>Vendor 1 is not multipart MIME savy given how it is wired into the
mail client (via scripting).&nbsp; As such it has limitations on it that
prevented it from dealing with any attachments we sent.&nbsp; This is not
a failure of the test but a restriction of the receiving client.
<p>Vendor2:
<br>Vendor2 was able to send back multiple responses to both the single
and repeating instances; to Accept, Decline and Tentatively Accept.&nbsp;
We were able to properly detect this status change and render it on our
end.
<p>The Not-so-good News:
<p>The testing done was more at an vendor to vendor level than a pure IETF
"RFC Conformance" test (where we test the explicit MUST/SHOULD/MAY/etc
requirements).&nbsp; We need to find a way to identify all of the IETF
requirements and map them to vendor to vendor tests that we generally do
(or provide some matrix of what we must test to satisfy the IETF requirements
for an interop event).
<p>We did not attempt any VTODO (aka Tasks) or VJOURNAL interop testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Per IETF rules, if we do not get any implementations that support them
then we must remove them from the standard in the future (but no timeframe
for this removal is clear).
<p>Particular notes relating to specific implementations:
<p>Vendor4:
<br>Vendor4 attempted to invite a Vendor3 user to a single instance of
a repeating set by sending the correct iCalendar message that uniquely
identified the single instance.&nbsp; We misconverted it to be a single
instance meeting that repeated at the original date/time (which was before
the actual instance date/time so thats not so good).
<p>Vendor1:
<br>Vendor1 had some small issues with adhering to the RFCs.&nbsp; Guenter
was very active in either fixing or explaining them.&nbsp; For example,
Vendor1 sends back ALL invitees on a REFRESH request but RFC 2446 expressly
states that only the requestors ATTENDEE info is allowed.&nbsp; As a result,
we incorrectly identify the "Request for Update" as being from the 1st
listed ATTENDEE rather than from the actual requestor.
<p>Vendor2:
<br>Vendor2 does not have full featured workflow support in yet.&nbsp;
They do not support delegation, counter proposals or anything associated
with them.&nbsp; While they do support the basic accept, decline and tentative
acceptances, the other iTIP messages are ignored or not supported so trying
them against an invitation from VENDOR2 results in an undetermined state
or loss of workflow (at least from the non-VENDOR2 POV).
<br>We did not receive any Vendor2 originating workflow, they simply responded
to the ones we sent out.&nbsp; As such, we do not know how well we interoperate
with them when they are the Organzier of an event or repeating event.&nbsp;
I was not able to find out if this was because we did not have enough testing
time or if they are unable to originate iCalendar workflow just yet
<p>Summary:
<p>Multipart support/formatting seems to be a source of confusion still
given the discussions held during the interop and on the chats.&nbsp; This
should NOT be a repeat issue but since its come up again we need to draft
some guidelines for the 'proper' multipart bundling of iCalendar above
and beyond the flat ASCII messages.
<p>By the next event we plan to have a formalized testing matrix and plan
that we can all use to do interop testing.&nbsp;&nbsp; There needs to be
some kind of mapping between what the IETF is looking for relating to standards
acceptance and what we implementors are looking for such as feature C&amp;S
workflow level interop.
<p>I'm working on making an understandable matrix of the MUST/SHOULD/MAY/etc
clauses in the RFCs and what they mean for testing.&nbsp; Given our pending
release schedules I did not have time to complete this lately.&nbsp; Hopefully
I can get it done after some hard earned time off and before we spin up
again.
