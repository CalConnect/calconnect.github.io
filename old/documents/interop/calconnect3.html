<br><a NAME="a1"></a><b>DETAILS</b>
<p>This is information on the CalConnect3 Interoperability Testing. Testing
will be held at the Novell Provo, Utah Campus when confirm the final dates.&nbsp;
We are going to try something new at this interop.&nbsp; There will a limited
number of "virtual seats" for electronic off-site participation.&nbsp;
These seats are designed to allow people who have developed open source
implementations to participate on our interoperability tests.&nbsp; The
assumption is funding is low for this type of organization and allowing
electronic participation will defray most of the costs.&nbsp; The reason
the number of seats will be limited is to avoid too much disruption to
the onsite work.&nbsp; Ideally, the best type of interop testing is to
be present onsite - you establish good relationships with other vendors
and the dinners are great!
<p><b>Registration:</b>
<br>Contact either Pat Egen (<a href="mailto:pregen@egenconsulting.com">pregen@egenconsulting.com</a>
) or Bob Mahoney (<a href="mailto:bobmah@mit.edu">bobmah@mit.edu</a> )
<p>Fee: $1000 (Up to two attendees)
<br>Electronic Only participation - $100.00 per organization (to offset
conferencing expenses).
<br>Payment methods: check payable to Patricia Egen Consulting - currently
working on PayPal service as well.

<p><b>Testing rules:</b>
<br>-----------------------
<br>Participants bring their own equipment and software.&nbsp; Ethernet
connectivity and networking will be provided as well as a mail server and
access to the Internet.&nbsp; Testing of applications and code is open.&nbsp;
This means there are no set steps or processes involved.&nbsp; You will
have a list of participants and will know what each vendor or representative
wants to test. It is every recipients responsibility to find other participants
to test applications.
<p>This effort will test everything we can on iCalendar, iTIP and iMIP.&nbsp;
The major emphasis will be on the iCalendar protocol.&nbsp; The chairs
will provide a matrix of all MUST, CAN and SHOULD statements that can be
used to help "check off" what is working and what is not.&nbsp; Each participant
is expected to detail what works and what does not and expected plans for
fixing or not fixing sections that do not work.&nbsp; If nothing will happen
on a specific item and participants do not plan to fix or make pieces work,
those items must be removed from the draft.
<p>The key rule is "What happens during testing remains in the room."&nbsp;
It is expected that participants will honor this rule.&nbsp; No press is
allowed and for the participants, please do not bring Marketing staff.
<p>The chairs of the CALSCH working group will publish the results and
further the movement of the RFC towards Standard activation.
