== General

Technical Committees are the technical working groups of CalConnect. A Technical
Committee is established with a specific charter (scope of work), time frame,
deliverables and expected schedule, and will disband when its scope of work is
completed.

Provisional Committees may be established at a CalConnect Conference to explore
a possible new work area of work and recommend whether CalConnect should move
forward in that area, generally by forming a new Technical Committee.
Provisional Committees are usually very short-lived, reporting out at the next
Conference.

The work of Technical Committees and Provisional Committees is guided and
coordinated by the Technical Coordination Committee (TCC).

Technical Committees generally produce CalConnect Work Products: Reports,
Recommendations, specifications, code artifacts, etc. Technical Committees also
produce draft specifications which may be published by CalConnect as a
CalConnect Standard, and/or submitted to an external SDO for progression within
that organization. Finally Technical Committees may also collaborate externally
towards the development of material which will not become a CalConnect Work
Product but may be part of some other joint effort. See
link:{{'/resources' | relative_url}}[CalConnect Resources] for more information.

Representatives of CalConnect members may participate upon any Technical
Committee by contacting the Chair of the TC. Members may propose new Technical
Committees to address areas of work not currently under consideration, and may
offer a Chair for a new TC (or PC).

For Closed Technical Committees please see link:{{'/about/technical-committees/closed-tcs' | relative_url }}[Closed Technical Committees].


== Technical Coordination Committee (TCC)

Details: https://public.calconnect.org/charter/charter-TCC/[Technical Coordination Committee (TCC)]

The TCC consists of the Chairs of the active Technical Committees and
Provisional Committees, and functions as an ongoing status and coordination
group for the Technical Committees under the guidance of the Board of Directors
or its representative. The Chair of the TCC is appointed by the Board upon
recommendation by the Chairs of the Technical Committees and after a periodic
call to the membership for volunteers. The TCC meets by conference call and
electronically on a regular basis as determined by the committee, generally
weekly, to ensure that TC activities are monitored and guided as necessary. The
TCC is also responsible for final approval for publication of Technical
Committee documents which have passed Last Call status, and with planning for
upcoming CalConnect events.
