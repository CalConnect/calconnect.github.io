== OASIS WS-Calendar

"Working with OASIS to develop their new WS-Calendar standard (scheduling for
the Smart Grid), based on xCal, CalWS-REST and CalWS-SOAP"

We are working with OASIS (the Organization for the Advancement of
Structured Information Systems) to develop their WS-Calendar standard.
It was original intended for the exchange of power information for the
smart grid, and is based on xCal (iCalendar in XML) and CalWS (web
services API for calendaring) protocols developed by CalConnect. OASIS
and CalConnect maintain reciprocal memberships and liaisons between
their WS-Calendar technical committee and our technical committees.
