== Developer's Guides

Create a "cookbook" guide and other supporting
materials for iCalendar and potentially other APIs such as CalDAV.

The lack of useful developer's guides and other documentation about
iCalendar, CalDAV, and other specifications is a problem for all current
and would-be developers in calendaring and scheduling.

link:{{'/tc-devguide' | relative_url }}[TC DEVGUIDE] has been formed to address this
lack by creating a "cookbook" guide and other supporting materials for
iCalendar and potentially other APIs such as CalDAV.
