title: Abstract Calendaring API
---

link:/7_things_api[*Abstract Calendaring API*] - We need a full
"CRUD" (Create/Read/Update/Delete) Abstract Application Programming
Interface and Calendaring Architecture for Calendaring and Scheduling.

An Abstract Calendaring API from which fully compliant interfaces can be
created will enable "Calendaring as a Platform" -- that is, any process
running on a system can use the API to perform calendar and scheduling
operations against any calendaring and scheduling implementation running
on that system. link:/tc-api[TC API].
