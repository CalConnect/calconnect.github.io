*CalWS-REST and CalWS-SOAP* - "We need to (finally) provide platform and
system-independent calendaring and scheduling operations APIs for web
services - it's long past time"

Calendaring (and scheduling) should be available as a service on any
platform with a calendaring system installed, much like middleware. To
make this work and expose the calendaring system to other applications,
widgets, and so forth, we need a platform-independent and
system-independent API for calendaring operations. CalWS-REST and
CalS-SOAP provide both RESTful and SOAPy web service implementations of
this API. The work is being done in partnership with OASIS; see OASIS
WS-Calendar below.
