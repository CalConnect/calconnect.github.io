title: VAVAILABILITY
---

"New iCalendar component to describe availability, to 'condition' freebusy
lookup and scheduling (e.g. you may be 'free' at 3 a.m. but you aren't available
for a meeting)"

VAVAILABILITY is a new component for iCalendar which allows an
individual to specify when they are available to be scheduled for
meetings (As opposed to "busy" when they already have a meeting
scheduled, or "free" when nothing is scheduled). VAVAILABILITY will also
allow the implementation of "office hours" applications, in particular
for academic institutions, and has significant use also in the smart
grid work being undertaken by OASIS.
