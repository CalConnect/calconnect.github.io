== iSCHEDULE

"We need server to server scheduling between dissimilar systems - we have had
client to server scheduling for a long time"

Scheduling a meeting between co-workers on a single calendaring system
has been available for a long time, but trying to schedule with people
on different calendar servers has only be available by hooking it onto
emails. iSchedule provides a system-independent server-to-server
mechanism to allow inter-system scheduling and ultimately "ad hoc"
scheduling - the ability to schedule a meeting or appointment with
anybody with a calendar and a calendar server, regardless of what system
they are on.
