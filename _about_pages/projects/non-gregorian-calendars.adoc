== Non-Gregorian Calendars

"Establish a way for recurrences to work with non-Gregorian calendar systems, in
particular lunar/solar calendars"

We have established the CALSCALE Ad Hoc committee to develop a draft
proposal for supporting recurrences for non-gregorian calendars via the
CALSCALE parameter in iCalendar and an RSCALE extension to RRULE. The
goal is to allow clients supporting non-gregorian calendars to create
recurring events without having to implement non-standard mechanisms. At
this point the draft has been submitted to the IETF and the discussion
is expected to continue on IETF mailing lists; we are not sure what
further work will be done within CalConnect.
