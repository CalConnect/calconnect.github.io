== Timezone service and registry

"Full timezone support via dynamic server calls rather than embedding timezone
information in events - no more having event times wrong when timezones change
and your software isn't updated"

Traditionally calendar entries coded in iCalendar have had to include
timezone information to allow interpretation of the date and time of an
event, and can be incorrect if the timezones have changed since the
information was put in the event. Having a separate, online timezone
service which can be queried at any time will allow timezone information
to be included by reference in events, rather than embedded in them, and
ensure correct interpretation of dates and times even if the information
changes.
