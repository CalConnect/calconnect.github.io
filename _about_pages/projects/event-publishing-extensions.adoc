== Event Publishing Extensions

"Calendaring standards need to support the rich environment of Web 2.0 (and
beyond) for the publication of public events - rich text, participants and image
support"

Events for publication require more and richer information than
conventional meeting events. CalConnect is working on defining some new
properties:

* structured locations - perhaps as vCards
* participants - for example, the team, audience, principal performer,
contacts
* rich and locale-specific descriptions - allows HTML and multi-language
support
* images
