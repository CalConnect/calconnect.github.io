== Autodiscovery

"One-stop setup for devices and new service providers for calendaring, e-mail,
etc. based on internet standard protocols"

Currently there is no simple, "one-stop" way to set up a collection of
internet standard services such as e-mail, calendaring, and so forth.
This is an issue when someone starts with a new organization or changes
service providers, and is even more difficult when one acquires a new
smartphone. We are working on a new standard protocol to specify how to
automatically discover and set up internet standards-based services such
as e-mail, calendaring, address book, etc. which can be implemented in a
single, easy to use user interface.
