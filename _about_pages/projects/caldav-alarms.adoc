"Extend alarm support to allow for cross-device dismissal, proximity triggers
based on location, default alarms in CalDAV"

Sharing calendars and tasks across multiple devices is great - having
the alarms go off on all of them isn't. This extension to CalDAV (the
standard calendar service protocol) will allow for effective user
management of alarms, including choosing which device(s) should enable
each alarm, and the form of the alarm.
