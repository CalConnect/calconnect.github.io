== vCard Resources

"Define the vCard representation of calendaring resources to ease the discovery
and scheduling of resources between any calendar client and server"

In keeping with the goal of TC RESOURCE to develop recommendations for
seamless interoperable resource scheduling, we have been working on
defining how such resources should be represented. RFC 6350 defines the
vCard format which allows the electronic capture and exchange of
information on users, devices, and more. link:{{'/tc-resource' | relative_url }}[TC RESOURCE]
is working on an extension of the vCard RFC to include all
required information for representing calendaring resources.
