"Extend the calendaring server to manage attachments"

This CalDAV extension will provide an interoperable and efficient
mechanism to allow clients to store and manage attachments associated
with a meeting (e.g. copy of a presentation, agenda,...) on a CalDAV
server. Beyond the basic storage aspect, the server also becomes
responsible for ensuring that only attendees of a meeting have access to
those attachments.
