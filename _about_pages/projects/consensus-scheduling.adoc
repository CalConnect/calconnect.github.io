== Consensus Scheduling (VPOLL)

"TimeTrade, Doodle, WhenisGood do it, it should be interoperable - scheduling
driven by the attendees who get to vote on the best times and locations for
group events"

Consensus scheduling involves using a poll-based or vote-based mechanism
to determine the date, time, location of an event or a task. This has
been implemented by several vendors in their own systems but should be
available and interoperable within mainstream scheduling. VPOLL is an
additional iCalendar and iTIP component designed to allow the
implementation of consensus scheduling with any system and client.
