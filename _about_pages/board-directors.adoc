== The CalConnect Board of Directors

_As of November 2022_

At this time, CalConnect has a maximum of seven directors. Officer
positions of the corporation defined in the Bylaws are appointed from
elected Directors. The Chair of the Technical Coordination Committee
(TCC) and the Technical Architect are _Ex Officio_ members of the Board
with full voting rights and responsibilities.

The Board holds quarterly scheduled Board Meetings in January, April,
July, and October, almost always by conference call. The Board also
holds bi-weekly conference calls for strategic planning and current
events updates.  The Board has held strategic planning retreats in 2005,
2012, 2015, 2018 and 2019, and anticipates doing so every few years in
the future.
