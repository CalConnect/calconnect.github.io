<h2>Calendaring and Scheduling Glossary of Terms V2.0</h2>
</div>
<br>
This document came about in an effort to compile, in one location, a common set of terminology with respect to calendaring and scheduling applications and standards. The document incorporates terminology already existing in calendaring standards such as <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5545.txt" target="_blank">RFC5545</a> (Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification (<a href="#iCalendar">iCalendar</a>)), <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5546.txt" target="_blank">RFC5546</a> (iCalendar Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol (<a href="#iTIP">iTIP</a>)), <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6047.txt" target="_blank">RFC6047</a> (iCalendar Message-Based Interoperability Protocol (<a href="#iMIP">iMIP</a>)), <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4791.txt" target="_blank">RFC4791</a> (Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV (<a href="#CalDAV">CalDAV</a>)) as well as input from members of the Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (<a href="#CalConnect">CalConnect</a>).
<br><br>
Some glossary terms may not appear in published standards today. These are common calendaring terms that are included so that everyone refers to components in the same manner.
<br><br>
As new standards evolve, the glossary will serve as a resource for those creating documents so that all the standards share a common set of terms.
<br><br>
Calendaring and scheduling implementers will be able to utilize the glossary to assist them as they read and decipher calendaring standards. Calendaring and scheduling users will be able to use the glossary to help them better understand the terminology deployed by applications written using calendaring standards.

<br>
<a name="Access Control"><b>Access Control</b></a> - Access control is a system which enables an authority (e.g., user or resource administrator) to control access to different entities in a calendar system. Typically vendors create Preference/Settings options to instantiate access control. Terminology varies considerably across products but broadly speaking access control is usually broken into two areas, read access and write access. Vendor terminology used for read access includes: 'read', 'reviewer', 'proxy read', 'viewer', 'see all', and 'see only freebusy'. Vendor terminology for write access includes: 'write', 'editor', 'proxy write', 'proxy', 'manager', 'administrator', 'designate', 'read/create/edit', 'make changes', 'manage', and 'edit'.

In <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5545.txt" target="_blank">RFC5545</a>, these are "VTODO" calendar components, which are groupings of component properties and possibly "VALARM" calendar components that represent an action-item or assignment.

Time zones are generally centered on meridians of a longitude, that is a multiple of 15, thus making neighboring time zones one hour apart. However, the one hour separation is not universal and the shapes of time zones can be quite irregular because they usually follow the boundaries of states, countries or other administrative areas. In <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5545.txt" target="_blank">RFC5545</a>, time zones are represented using "VTIMEZONE" calendar components, each with a Time Zone Identifier (TZID) that can be used to tie a particular date and time to a specific timezone.

An example is UTC-8 (Pacific Standard Time). Some iCalendar examples:

<blockquote>
DTSTART:19970714T133000 ;Local time<br>
DTSTART:19970714T173000Z ;UTC time<br>
DTSTART;TZID=US-Eastern:19970714T133000 ;Local time and time zone reference
</blockquote>

<hr>
<br>
<a name="VALARM"><b>VALARM</b></a> - A VALARM calendar component is a grouping of component properties that is a reminder or alarm for an event or a to-do.  For example, it may be used to define a reminder for a pending event or an overdue to-do. VALARMs will thus be included within <a href="#VEVENT">VEVENT</a> and <a href="#VTODO">VTODO</a> components.

<a name="vCalendar"><b>vCalendar</b></a> - A text representation of calendar and scheduling data created by the Versit consortium (also, the vCalendar specification). The <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5545.txt" target="_blank">RFC5545</a> iCalendar specification supersedes the work of vCalendar, though VCALENDAR remains as a component type in the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5545.txt" target="_blank">RFC5545</a> iCalendar specification.
<br><br>
<a name="VEVENT"><b>VEVENT</b></a> - A VEVENT calendar component represents a scheduled amount of time on a calendar.  For example, it can be an activity; such as a one-hour long, department meeting from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, tomorrow. Generally, an event will take up time on an individual calendar. The VEVENT is also the calendar component used to specify an anniversary or daily reminder within a calendar.

The VJOURNAL calendar component can also be used to associate a document with a calendar date.
