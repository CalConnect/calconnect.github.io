== CalConnect joins the Metaverse Standards Forum

CalConnect is now a principal member of the Metaverse Standards Forum. CalConnect standards are used ubiquitously and our mandate extends to the metaverse.

We are proud to be the first group of SDOs that prioritises the need of standards in the metaverse.

We look forward to the creation of an interoperable metaverse inclusive to all.
