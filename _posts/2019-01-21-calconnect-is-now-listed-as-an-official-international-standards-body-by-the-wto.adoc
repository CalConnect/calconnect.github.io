== CalConnect is now listed as an official international standards body by the WTO

[[node-500]]
Posted January 21, 2019 

I am very pleased to announce that CalConnect is now officially listed as an international standards body by the World Trade Organization:&nbsp; https://tbtcode.iso.org/sites/wto-tbt/contents/json/185.html[].&nbsp; The document describing our alignment with WTO principles may be found here:&nbsp; https://standards.calconnect.org/csd/cc-10100.html[].

CalConnect now has active liaisons with several international organizations including 10 liaisons with ISO committees:&nbsp; ISO/TC 37, ISO TC/46, ISO TC 154, ISO/TC 211, ISO/PC 317 and ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 27.&nbsp; We are participating in the work program of most of of these in particular in areas such as date/time formats, time zone management, structured name and address standards, and privacy by design.

For a full list of CalConnect liaisons and involvement, please see link://about/liaisons-and-relationships[].&nbsp;

On behalf of CalConnect I would like to thank Ronald Tse of Ribose, our Director of External Relations, for supporting and driving our standards program, together with everyone who is representing CalConnect in standards activities.
